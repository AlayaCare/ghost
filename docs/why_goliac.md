# Why Goliac

There are several existing tools that can help you define automatically your Github organization

## Why not using terraform/another tool

You can use Terraform to achieve almost the same result, except that with terraform, you still need to centrally managed all operations via your IT team.

Goliac allows you to provide a self-served tool to all your employees

## Why not using Github integrations

Github itself allows you different integrations (see `https://github.com/ORG/goliac-project/settings/security`), in particular 
- SSO users integration (SAML)
- and teams integration (Azure Active Directory and Okta)

If Github integration fits your needs, go for it. But if you want some flexibility (creating teams independently than the company organization, not having to rely on the IT departement each time you want to create a repository), Goliac may be more flexible to use.
